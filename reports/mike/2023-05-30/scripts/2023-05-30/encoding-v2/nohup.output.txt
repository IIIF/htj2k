Note:
    If you want quality scalability, you should generate multiple layers with
    `-rate' or by using the "Clayers" option.

Generated 1 tile-part(s) for a total of 1 tile(s).
Code-stream bytes (excluding any file format) = 9,032,959 = 0.769905 bits/pel.
Compressed bytes (excludes codestream headers) = 9,025,086 = 0.769234 bpp.
Body bytes (excludes packet and codestream headers) = 8,979,103 = 0.765315 bpp.
